<p class='content'>I'm Alessandra Bilardi. I was born in <a href='http://www.comune.mirano.ve.it/eng/eng-home.htm'>Mirano</a>, <a href='http://www.turismovenezia.it/eng/dynalay.asp?PAGINA=5659'>Venice</a>, <a href='http://www.enit.it/'>Italy</a> back in the year of 1978. I live in <a href='http://www.riviera-brenta.it/eng/'>Venice province</a>, Italy. I'm partner of wonderful man and mum of nice baby.</p>
<p class='content'>My professional profile is <a href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/bilardi'>here</a>. I draw my comics since 1992.</p>
<p class='content'>It is very important to repeat that I'm italian women so my comics have got italian last name rigorously and a lot of their histories set in my land. Meantime, choose about last name of my comics is to the memory of my uncle Marino.</p>
